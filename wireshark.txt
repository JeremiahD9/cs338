===== DAYTIME =====
1) 
1 192.168.199.128 129.6.15.29 TCP [SYN]...
2 129.6.15.29 192.168.199.128 TCP [SYN, ACK]...
3 192.168.199.128 129.6.15.29 TCP [ACK]...

2) Port number 13

3) So that the server knows where to deliver the IP Packet

4) 4 129.6.15.29 192.168.199.128 DAYTIME...

5) [SYN] establish communication between machines. [ACK] acknowledges that the message was received.

6) The client initiated the closing of the TCP connection. This can be confirmed by seeing which machine sent the [FIN] package first.


===== HTTP =====
Correct Filter: host 172.233.221.124
1) 44 TCP connections were opened. I can tell by checking the number value of the last entry recorded by Wireshark

2) 9	0.034105022	192.168.199.128	172.233.221.124	TLSv1.3	571	Client Hello (SNI=cs338.jeffondich.com). This appears to be the client attempting to retrieve a response from the webpage

3) I can't tell where the photograph is being requested. The information displayed by Wireshark doesn't appear specific enough for me to pinpoint frame.

===== QUESTIONS =====
1) What do the different versions of TLC stand for and what do they do?

2) What does change cipher spec, application data mean?

3) Can you explain why it appears that some frames are duplicates?

4) Can you go more into depth of what the frames Client Hello and Server Hello do, how do they differ from [SYN]
